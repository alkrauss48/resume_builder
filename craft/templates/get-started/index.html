          <h2>Get Started</h2>
          <p>Let's build an awesome resume together.</p>
        </header>
        <p>Paper resumes dominate the job searching market, but you can't
        do much with them. No hiring manager will ever see your Microsoft Word
        resume and think "Wow, this is really well designed." And you
        might think, that's not the point of your resume - the point is
        the content and not how it looks. But really, think about it. If
        something is well built, we tend to spend more time with it and
        admire the actual content much more than something that is just
        thrown together. Still, you're pretty limited with an 8.5 x 11
        inch sheet of paper. That's where we come in. </p>
        <p><b>Resume Haus</b> specializes in building and hosting high quality resumes that leverage
        the true power of the web to show off who you really are. We
        account for all different types of data you may want to
        show off, like blocks of text, education, work experience, skills,
        awards, interests, and literally anything you can think of. If
        it's on your current resume - we'll make it look beautiful on your
        Resume Haus resume.</p>

          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>You don't pay a cent until your
          resume is built. Here's the plan:</p>
        </header>
        <ul>
          <li><p>1) Complete the form below and upload your resume. Leave any
          additional information such as your desired theme or your
          Google Analytics ID number.</p></li>
          <li><p>2) We'll receive your information and will begin building your
          resume.</p></li>
          <li><p>3) Once we're complete, we'll email you back with a public URL
          for your resume to verify everything
          looks good. If not, we'll hammer out what needs fixing.</p></li>
          <li><p>4) After everything looks good, we'll link you to a payment
          page. If we don't receive payment within a week of completion, your
          resume will be temporarily removed until payment is completed.</p></li>
          <li><p>5) We're done! You can link your resume to anyone you want
          to impress. We will personally host your resume so you don't need to
          worry about a thing - your resume will be publicly available at
          <b>http://resumehaus.com/your-name</b>.</p></li>
          <li><p></p></li>
        </ul>
