                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>Let's build an awesome resume together, one step at
                a time.</p>
              </header>
              <p>Paper resumes dominate the job searching market, but you can't
              do much with them really. No hiring manager will ever see your
              resume and think "Wow, this is really well designed." And you
              might think, that's not the point of your resume - the point is
              the content and not how it looks. But really, think about it. If
              something is well built, we tend to spend more time with it and
              admire the actual content much more than something that is just
              thrown together. Still, you're pretty limited with an 8.5 x 11
              inch sheet of paper. That's where we come in. </p>
              <p><b>Resume Haus</b> offers high quality resume templates that leverage
              the true power of the web to show off who you really are. We
              account for all different types of data you may want to
              show off, like text blocks, education, work experience, skills,
              awards, interests, and literally anything you can think of. If
              it's on your current resume - you can put it on your Resume Haus
              resume.</p>

                <h2>How to Begin</h2>
                <p>You don't pay a cent until your
                resume is built. Here's the plan:</p>
            </header>
            <ul>
              <li><p>1) Complete the form below and upload your resume. Leave any
              comments such as your desired theme or your
              Google Analytics id number</p></li>
              <li><p>2) I'll receive your information and will begin building your
              resume.</p></li>
              <li><p>3) Once I'm complete, I'll email you back with a public URL
              for your resume to verify everything
              looks good. If not, we'll hammer out what needs fixing.</p></li>
              <li><p>4) After everything looks good, I'll link you to a payment
              page. If I don't receive payment within a week of completion, your
              resume will be temporarily removed until payment is completed.</p></li>
              <li><p>5) We're done! You can link your resume to anyone you want
              to impress.</p></li>
              <li><p></p></li>
            </ul>
